Number Data Type in Python

	Python supports integers, floating point numbers and complex numbers. 
	They are defined as int, float and complex class in Python.

	Integers and floating points are separated by the presence or absence of a decimal point. 
	5 is integer whereas 5.0 is a floating point number.

	Complex numbers are written in the form, x + yj, where x is the real part 
	and y is the imaginary part.

	We can use the type() function to know which class a variable or a 
	value belongs to and isinstance() function to check if it belongs to a particular class.

	Python Decimal
	Python built-in class float performs some calculations that might amaze us. 
	We all know that the sum of 1.1 and 2.2 is 3.3, but Python seems to disagree.

	from decimal import Decimal as D
	# Output: Decimal('3.3')
	print(D('1.1') + D('2.2'))

	# Output: Decimal('3.000')
	print(D('1.2') * D('2.50'))

	Python Mathematics
	Python offers modules like math and random to carry out different mathematics 
	like trigonometry, logarithms, probability and statistics, etc.

	import math

	# Output: 3.141592653589793
	print(math.pi)

	# Output: -1.0
	print(math.cos(math.pi))

	# Output: 22026.465794806718
	print(math.exp(10))

	# Output: 3.0
	print(math.log10(1000))

	# Output: 1.1752011936438014
	print(math.sinh(1))

	# Output: 720
	print(math.factorial(6))

	import random

	# Output: 16
	print(random.randrange(10,20))

	x = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']

	# Get random choice
	print(random.choice(x))

	# Shuffle x
	random.shuffle(x)

	# Print the shuffled x
	print(x)

	# Print random element
	print(random.random())
